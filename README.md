# VRMaze
 A simple VR maze built as a class project.

The project was made using Unity's OpenXR plugin to work with a wide varaiety of headsets. Assets from the [snaps prototype](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/snaps-prototype-office-137490#description) were used.

The maze layout itself was built using [ProBuilder](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.probuilder@5.0/manual/index.html) and [ProGrids](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.progrids@3.0/manual/index.html) on Unity 2021.3.0f1.
